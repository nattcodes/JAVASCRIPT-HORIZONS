#### For, While, Do While

- **Task: Fibonacci Sequence**
  Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using both `for` and `while`.

#### forEach, for...in

- **Task: Array and Object Traversal**
  Create a script that uses `forEach` to iterate over an array and `for...in` to iterate over an object, printing each value.

#### Break/Continue

- **Task: Skip Multiples**
  Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 20 but skips multiples of 3 using `continue`.

---

### **9. Functions**

#### Parameters/Arguments

- **Task: Sum Function**
  Write a function that accepts two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

#### Return

- **Task: Cube Calculation**
  Write a function that takes a number and returns its cube.

#### Anonymous Functions

- **Task: Button Click Handler**
  Write an anonymous function that logs a message when a button is clicked.

#### Recursive Functions

- **Task: Factorial Calculation**
  Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

#### Default Parameters

- **Task: Greeting**
  Write a function that takes a name and prints a greeting, with a default value for the name if no argument is provided.

---

### **10. Objects and Prototype**

#### Key, Value, Method

- **Task: Object Basics**
  Create an object with keys, values, and a method that prints one of the values.

#### Constructor Functions

- **Task: Object Creator**
  Write a constructor function to create objects representing a car (with properties like `brand` and `model`).

#### Prototype

- **Task: Add Prototype Method**
  Add a method to the prototype of your car constructor to display the car details.

#### Object Destructuring

- **Task: Extract Properties**

#### Text Node, Element Node, Child Node, Parent Node, Descendant Node, Sibling Node

- **Task: DOM Navigation**
  Write a script to navigate and print the structure of a webpage using parent, child, descendant, and sibling properties.

#### Query/Get Element

- **Task: Highlight Element**
  Use `document.querySelector` to change the background color of a specific element.

#### Create/Clone Element

- **Task: Add Elements**
  Write a script to dynamically create and clone a list item (`<li>`) in a list (`<ul>`).

#### Add Node to Document

- **Task: Dynamic Node Addition**
  Add a new paragraph to a webpage when a button is clicked.

#### Get Element Details

- **Task: Inspect Elements**
  Write a script that logs the `id`, `class`, and `innerText` of a selected element.

#### Modify Element

- **Task: Text Updater**
  Create a program that changes the text of a heading (`<h1>`) dynamically.

#### Get and Modify Element Class

- **Task: Class Toggle**
